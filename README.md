# The Architect's Spell Pack

This spell pack is a [Wizards of Lua](http://www.wizards-of-lua.net) add-on that adds the /architect command to the Minecraft game.

By executing the /architect command you can turn yourself into an architect.
As an architect you are able to define what happens when you place a block into the world.
For example, if you activate the BAR tool, you can build a stack of blocks with just one click.
